## Importing a recipe.

Mealie can import recipes from most recipe websites out of the box. However, certain websites like reddit are unsupported. If you have enabled OpenAI integration you can use the AI-powered extraction tool within Mealie to assist with parsing recipes from unsupported sites. This feature can help automatically extract ingredients and instructions. To import a recipe from a URL:

1. Under your username in the top left corner of the website, click create.
2. Click import
3. Copy and paste the URL into the Recipe URL box.
4. Click stay in edit mode and click create. The recipe will be imported. But you need to parse the ingridients for it to make sense.
5. Click the settings button under description and click disable ingridients amounts. 
5. Under the ingredients section, click the parse button. It will have an apple symbol. The ingredients will be parsed by the Natural Language Proccessor by default. If you have enabled OpenAI integration, you can also choose to use the AI parser by selecting it from the dropdown menu next to the parse button. This may provide better results for complex or unusual ingredient lists.
6. Click the create missing food buttons if the ingredients are not already in your database. If the food is nonscensical, click the choose food box and manually enter in the desired food and add it to the database, or select an already existing food.
7. When you are done parseing ingridients. Click save at the top right corner.
8. Your recipe is now imported and ready to use. You can further edit the recipe details, add images, or categorize it as needed. Lastly, you are now able to change the serving number and associated ingredient quantities accordingly.
